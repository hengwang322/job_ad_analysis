Welcome!

We're so happy you found us. Since you've come this far, it's safe to say you're curious about our story and what career opportunities exist, so we'd love to start by introducing ourselves.

Then & Now

Our story ( https://envato.com/blog/the-story-of-envato/ ) starts in 2006 with three founders in a Sydney garage (no, we're not kidding). Born from a desire to earn a living doing what they loved, with the flexibility ( https://envato.com/blog/flexibility-at-the-heart-of-life-at-envato/ ) to do it from anywhere, Envato set out to create an online community for buying and selling creative digital assets. Nearly 13 years later, we're profitable and still totally bootstrapped. This allows us to stay experimental and totally focused on the best interests of our authors & customers around the world.

We've built marketplaces where anyone can buy and sell the creative assets they need to complete their projects faster. Our community can now buy millions of different kinds of assets on Envato Market ( https://themeforest.net/ ), or subscribe to the #1 unlimited subscription service for creatives, Envato Elements ( https://elements.envato.com/ ). Every day, these products continue to help everyone from freelancers to small business owners and agencies get their creative projects done.

While we are known and loved within the digital professional community globally, where our authors have earned over $750 million ( http://press.envato.com/172514-envato-closes-in-on-1-billion-usd-in-community-earnings ), we also want to be a place where anyone can Make with Envato. Alongside Market & Elements, our portfolio also includes Milkshake ( https://milkshake.app/ ), a website builder for Instagrammers, Placeit ( https://placeit.net/ ), a smart template tool for logos, mockups, graphic design & more, Mixkit ( https://mixkit.co/ ), for free stock footage and animation, and most recently, Twenty20 ( https://www.twenty20.com/ ), a stock-photo subscription service.

With over 600 people globally, we have offices in Guadalajara, Mexico ( https://envato.com/blog/placeit-joins-envato/ ) & Los Angeles ( https://envato.com/blog/twenty20-joins-the-envato-family/ ), alongside our funky Melbourne HQ. We pride ourselves on being remote friendly, with a staffing population just as diverse as the global community that use our products. To keep this sustainable as we scale, we support people to work from anywhere, whether that's the beach in Croatia, on the Mornington Peninsula, or from their living room.

What you'll be doing

Lead the vision, innovation and development of search & discovery at Envato. You will be working with various teams to provide a first-class search and discovery experience for our customers.

Who is CHE Proximity
More than ever before the medium, the message and it's sequencing are inseparable from each other.
‘Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce.
This is what we call Connected Creativity.

Please rest assured the above is not the case as we are talking about a ""specialist"" here.
A data consulting business working with robust corporate customers across Australia, NZ, SEA and the UK.

Here there is a culture of ongoing education, team, customer centricity and early adoption of data analytics technologies (specifically cloud-centric).

The head office has harbour views and operates very much as the central HQ for all consultants, so you'll spend a few times a week here. Most of your time, however, will be spent on client sites; ranging from banks and retailers to global technology companies (some pretty cool ones).

We're not going to list every Data Engineering tech under the sun here, but if you have experience with:

AWS, GCP environments,
Spark,
SQL and languages such as Python, Go and Scala

You may very well be a fit for some solid projects here.

We are also open to candidates who have some data engineering experience and are looking to step into their first ""pure"" data engineer role.

Data Engineer,Data Engineer,MessageMedia,Melbourne VIC,,$90000-$99999,,"If you can stare a Tableau report into submission or coax a Pentaho dashboard into giving you everything you need then you'll most likely find our role rather intriguing.
We're hiring someone to join our team who's really intrigued and motivated by data, lots of data, so, yes data. We need someone who's articulate. We need someone who can translate complex and at times clunky data into intuitive insights and start thinking about what the future holds for us.
The company is growing and so our data capability needs to as well. As part of a small, but growing team, you'll be responsible for analysis, transformation and integration of various data sources into business intelligence/reporting systems. Supported by a senior data analyst, business SMEs and other stakeholders, you'll need to understand, enhance and maintain existing data pipelines, as well as building new integrations from an array of operational and financial data sources.
As the team capability matures, we will develop a more data science focus - shifting from reporting to predictive analytics and insights. So as a critical part of the Data team, this role will expand in scale and responsibility, with exposure to new tools, technologies and areas of the business.
Initially, we'll ask you to do these things:
Maintain and optimise existing data pipelines (integrations) in a Pentaho/Tableau BI platform
Analyse, extract, cleanse and transform data to ensure it is fit for purpose
Identify, design and implement process improvements, and automation to optimise the data pipelines
Develop a comprehensive understanding of the data environment and be able to analyse, understand and effectively respond to queries on data transformations/integrations, and their impact on the data warehouse / BI system
Support Finance, Sales, Strategy and Technology stakeholders to get the data they need for ad-hoc queries
Work with the data analyst and other team members to design, build and test data analysis /integration solutions, from concept through to prototyping and production phases
Be agile, informed and responsive to business priorities, while ensuring the security, robustness and scalability of data solutions
This means you'll need the following technical/experience profile;
A passion for data and technology.
A working knowledge of Finance principles, in other words, you know what “Month End reporting”, “Debtors and Creditors” and “Cashflow” are.
Exceptional analytical capability and attention to detail
Solid experience with Pentaho and Tableau (ideal), or similar ETL/BI tools
Extensive experience using SQL to query, extract and transform from data sources such as Redshift, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Salesforce
Experience with scripting or other languages (e.g. Python, Java), and exposure to AWS services (EC2, RDS, Kinesis)
Experience working with data in a billing, financial planning and sales operations context
You'll find that the teams you work with are committed technologists who are eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what's essential. We're quick to trust. We see things through. We're kind to each other, look up to each other, and support each other. We achieve together. We are colleagues, here to do our best work.
Our behaviours of Use Judgement, Think Customer and Be Hungry are what have made us pretty successful so far. We're shaping up to become a global force in business messaging so people whose personal values kind of tie in with these will feel incredibly comfortable here and will probably be excited by the value they can add.

HotDoc is looking for an ethically minded Senior Data Engineer to help us change how doctors and patients communicate. Help us take the next step forward on our journey in improving patient healthcare one algorithm at a time. Are you an operational thinker? Are you looking to apply your experience in building data analytic systems in a way that is meaningful? This is an incredible opportunity to work for a fast-growing health-tech startup where you have both scope and support for professional and personal growth, your opinions are heard, and your actions make a difference to thousands of patients and healthcare providers across Australia.

What’s in it for you?
We offer a market salary with startup perks. You’ll get to experience your contribution to the company first hand. Enjoy flexible work arrangements while thriving in an ethically driven company that fosters inclusivity and a collaborative work environment, where personal development and career progression aren’t just buzz words.
What will you be doing?
In this role, reporting to the Head of Operations, you'll help set a vision for data-driven, automated company operations, and work with a small team of dedicated engineers and data scientists to execute that vision.
You’ll collaborate with people across the business to identify their data requirements, then design and build pipelines to blend data from varied sources into a usable format to support those operations
You’ll implement code & data quality testing procedures to ensure the trustworthiness of the data
Along the way, you will help set the way the operations data team functions — codifying HotDoc’s framework for incorporating new systems, datasets, reports, and analytics
Our stack is based around Stitch, Airflow, BigQuery, and Metabase, with a lot of Python glue — but nothing is set in stone.

Who will you be doing it for?
As the preferred vendor of healthcare software solutions, HotDoc is improving the patient experience for over 4 million Australians and counting. HotDoc helps bridge the gap between patient and doctors nationwide, by providing cutting edge technology and an easy, proactive, and accessible means of managing the patient journey from booking to check-in.

The above and beyond skill set of the Senior Engineer is the ability to bring the customer on a journey, helping them understand they aren’t the first to build a scalable, reliable and auditable big data pipeline, to sit with them and help get things over the line and to help win “hearts and minds” across customers internally where Cloud or Big Data analytics are still a foreign term or used in name but not in practice.

Strong analytic skills related to working with unstructured datasets.
Build processes supporting data transformation, data structures, metadata, dependency and workload management.
A successful history of manipulating, processing and extracting value from large disconnected datasets.
Working knowledge of message queuing, stream processing, and highly scalable ‘big data’ data stores
Have experience with the AWS ecosystem (particularity Kinesis, Glue, Redshift, EMR, RDS, Aurora, DMS, etc…)
Have exposure to the broader Hadoop and broader data warehouse ecosystems (Cloudera, Hortonworks, Exadata, Greenplum, Terradata, SAP Hana etc)
Have some experience with industry leading ETL tools, Informatica, Talend, Snowflake
Familiar with data modelling concepts
Familiar with end user analytic tools such as SAS, Tableau, etc
Can demonstrate what discipline looks like in the AWS ecosystem
Advanced experience in one or many of the following programming languages – SQL, Python, Java, SCALA etc

OUR CULTURE

We have offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Denver and Singapore and have grown to over 350 people in just five years! We are the Australian AWS Consulting partner for the Year for the 3rd time and recently became a Snowflake and Talend Partner.

Our Senior Data Engineers have been around the block a few times and have some battle scars from building data pipelines in the cloud in an automated fashion. They will have worked in larger teams and understand the Corporate Wheel of Death (Risk, Security, Governance, Finance, etc…) and have worked through these issues before.

The above and beyond skill set of the Senior Engineer is the ability to bring the customer on a journey, helping them understand they aren’t the first to build a scalable, reliable and auditable big data pipeline, to sit with them and help get things over the line and to help win “hearts and minds” across customers internally where Cloud or Big Data analytics are still a foreign term or used in name but not in practice.

Ability to lead change with customers
Focus on delivery and outcomes
Delivery sprint tasks within the sprint

Workshops and agree technical approaches with team members and customers
Can work in an enterprise-type environment and demonstrate the expected controls and processes adherence.
Understand traditional and emerging data pipeline delivery as well as CI and CD processes
Lead and mentor Data engineers

People wanting to become Senior Data Engineers at Versent have the following skills;
From a development or operations background (or an existing DataOps Team)
Advanced working SQL knowledge and experience working with relational databases, query authoring (SQL) as well as working familiarity with a variety of databases.
Experience building and optimizing ‘big data’ data pipelines, architectures and data sets.
Experience performing root cause analysis on internal and external data and processes to answer specific business questions and identify opportunities for improvement.
Strong analytic skills related to working with unstructured datasets.
Build processes supporting data transformation, data structures, metadata, dependency and workload management.
A successful history of manipulating, processing and extracting value from large disconnected datasets.
Working knowledge of message queuing, stream processing, and highly scalable ‘big data’ data stores
Have experience with the AWS ecosystem (particularity Kinesis, Glue, Redshift, EMR, RDS, Aurora, DMS, etc…)
Have exposure to the broader Hadoop and broader data warehouse ecosystems (Cloudera, Hortonworks, Exadata, Greenplum, Terradata, SAP Hana etc)
Have some experience with industry leading ETL tools, Informatica, Talend, Snowflake
Familiar with data modelling concepts
Familiar with end user analytic tools such as SAS, Tableau, etc
Can demonstrate what discipline looks like in the AWS ecosystem
Advanced experience in one or many of the following programming languages – SQL, Python, Java, SCALA etc

We have many social events, often supporting charity initiatives such as TourXOz and RUOK Day. We also have family functions such as lawn bowls, company picnics etc. We have a paid parental leave program.

We embrace the notion of Versent as a Family, working together to achieve outstanding success.

We have flexible working hours and a culture based on respect, trust and collaboration.

WHY WE'RE DIFFERENT

You know, work doesn't have to feel like work. In fact, we don't want it to. That's why we've cultivated an environment based on creativity. Because when people who care about their craft are given the freedom to explore possibilities without restriction, amazing things can happen.

OUR CULTURE

No cool cliques, just hard-working humans generating ideas and devising solutions in a creative, collaborative work space. Professional but not corporate, we believe success is achieved through strong leadership (without interference from middle-management) and an autonomous working environment backed by the moral support of like-minded peers. This is a highly collaborative, supportive environment.

VERSENT VALUES AND BEHAVIOURS
People: We believe in a positive team with family spirit, because life is to short for anything else.
Customer: We create remarkable experiences for customers and treat them as you would wish to be treated.

A mature startup that's really making it's mark both locally and in the USA.


The company has been been busy growing their footprint, and have done so spectacularly well. Their reporting and BI environment is though not nearly as mature - now they are looking to fix that!

The role

They run a SQL stack, running off a cloud backbone. Tableau has been selected to be the key reporting & visualization tool. They are narrowing down the final choice of ETL rool.

They have a data engineer aboard and a system analyst who is draining together simple reports in Excel. It's almost a greenfields environment

Initially the role will focus of building a number of much needed simple Tableau reports. As through you get to better know the business and stakeholders and the tech stack and data, the role will become more forward thinking, building dashboards to enable a self service culture, and even being able to create insights the business may not realise they're able to access.

So it's a genuinely cool role. Some simple and straight forward tasks to get you started, and the role then morphs into a more strategic position.

So what do we need?

Someone withe strong tech skills with SQL and tableau. Skills with ETL tools would also be a bonus, but the flavour of ETL tool isn't critical.

An understanding of data modelling would also be valuable.

Strong communication skills also matter. You're going to be engaging a range of stakeholders across the business.

Above all though, we need someone friendly, personable, confident but humble with it.


What's in it for you?

About AbSec

AbSec -NSW Child, Family and Community Peak Aboriginal Corporation is the peak Aboriginal organisation in

the NSW child and family welfare sector. We provide an Aboriginal perspective on child protection and out-

of-home care policy to the NSW Government, and support the Aboriginal community-controlled sector to

deliver effective services for Aboriginal children and families. We are a not-for-profit, incorporated

community organisation, governed by an all-Aboriginal board.

We recently established AbSec Learning and Development Centre (AbSec LDC), a subsidiary organisation and

registered training organisation. AbSec LDC is the only registered training organisation in NSW owned and

managed by Aboriginal people in the child and family support sector, offering recognised qualifications in

disability support, family welfare and child protection, as well as governance, leadership and management.

Our Vision

Aboriginal children and young people are looked after in safe, thriving Aboriginal families and communities.

They are raised strong in spirit and identity, with every opportunity for lifelong wellbeing and connection to

culture.

Our Principles

• Acknowledgement and respect – acknowledging the diversity of all Aboriginal nations and respecting
traditional owners of the land, constantly reminded by Elders, and cultural knowledge of communities to

inform our action
Professionalism and integrity – acting with the highest level of professionalism for our communities,
ensuring our integrity will not be compromised in striving for the provision of quality, culturally responsive

and accessible supports

Ab Sec NSW Child, Family and Community Peak Aboriginal Corporation
Caring for our children, families and communities


Self-determination – ensuring that our focus is underpinned by the rights of Aboriginal people to make
decisions that impact their lives, recognising the interests of Aboriginal children, young people, families and

carers, and communities in all that we do
Independence and solutions focused – serving the interests of Aboriginal children, young people, families,
people with disability, communities and the organisations that support them to deliver holistic approaches

to issues impacting them
Transparency and commitment – remaining committed to our people in everything we do, ensuring our
actions are clear and promoted at every opportunity

Position Purpose & Context

The Data Analyst role is established to support AbSec’s work strengthening the Aboriginal child and family

sector. The role will work within AbSec to support the collection, analyse and reporting of data to support

planning and evidence building for the benefit of Aboriginal children and young people, their families and

communities.

AbSec has outlined an Aboriginal commissioning approach as a key element of an effective Aboriginal

service system. This requires undertaking data-informed approaches to service system planning, as well as

the development of an Aboriginal community controlled data system to support outcomes-focused

commissioning. Consistent with the principles of self-determination and Aboriginal data sovereignty,

AbSec’s data analyst will support Aboriginal community controlled organisations to develop localised data

infrastructure and processes, aligned to community aspirations for Aboriginal children and families.

Key tasks include supporting the development of an Aboriginal-led Commissioning approach in two

locations in NSW (mid-North Coast and South West Sydney), with a view to expanding this pending success.

Aboriginal-led commissioning will mean AbSec can conceptualise a support system model, co-design it with

communities, contract local organisations for its delivery, and hold the primary relationship with

government for delivery of Aboriginal community-defined outcomes for Aboriginal people and

communities. AbSec’s commissioning work will be high profile, as it will be the first for Australia to engage

genuinely with a non-government, Aboriginal peak organisation in this way. Similar approaches have been

adopted in New Zealand and Canada, where we will be able to look to for some guidance (however this will

be unique to AbSec).

Some core accountabilities for this ‘Commissioning’ component will be:

Delivery of operational frameworks within AbSec (including contract management, funding
management, procurement, commissioning, complaints, enhancing delegations etc with a focus on

managing conflicts between decisions made at the operational level of AbSec and the Board of

Governance)
Engagement with communities and key stakeholders in the locations identified to co-design a support
system
Leading a control group to guide this work, including the establishment of an evaluation (to be
conducted by FACS with input from Treasury and DPC).

The Data Analyst role will also engage with Aboriginal communities across NSW to establish and

operationalise an effective Aboriginal community controlled data system. This approach aims to empower

Aboriginal communities to develop their own data capabilities to develop evidence of effective approaches

Ab Sec NSW Child, Family and Community Peak Aboriginal Corporation
Caring for our children, families and communities


to Aboriginal child and family service provision, and to support the continuous improvement initiatives of

Aboriginal community organisations.

Key Accountabilities

The role supports the commissioning of Aboriginal child and family services, and the development of

evidence building and continuous improvement frameworks for Aboriginal community controlled

organisations:

Assisting with market intelligence through the compilation and analysis and reporting of data on
guardianship orders and other information in targeted areas to identify service need and support

investment decisions.
Analysing program delivery costs to support procurement activities, including assisting with the
assessment of proposals for funding.
Supporting provider capability, for example with:
Creating frameworks for data collection to assist in measuring and reporting on program
outcomes.

Assisting in the development of monitoring and evaluation frameworks.
Designing and generating statistical reports to inform decision-making, evidence building and
continuous improvement initiatives.

Key Challenges

• Understanding the complexity of the Aboriginal child and family system within NSW.

Building an understanding of ACCO service providers in the system.
Developing an understanding of program logic models and outcomes measurement.
Building capacity of under-resourced Aboriginal child and family organisations
Key Relationships for Success

Internal Contacts:

Executive Leader – Strategy, Policy and Engagement and team
Executive Leader – Commissioning & Quality and team

External Contacts:
Aboriginal community-controlled agencies, including member agencies
Other peak bodies including SNAICC (the national peak for Aboriginal children and families) and ACWA
(Association of Children’s Welfare Agencies)

Selection Criteria

• An understanding of Aboriginal culture and the issues facing the Aboriginal non-government sector and

We try to be as lean as we can, avoiding red tape and bureaucracy. We do our best to maintain the 'startup' look and feel, but without the constraints and overheads usually associated with less well-established organisations.

We're small enough that your voice will be heard loud and clear, and your (excellent) ideas and innovations will be championed and rapidly adopted. And we're large enough that we can execute on these ideas at scale and your work will be used by hundreds of thousands of (happy) customers.

But wait, there's more. As well as being an awesome place to innovate, drive change and make a difference, amaysim also tries to be a place that keeps you excited to come in on a Monday morning through all kinds of fun extras, including:

Business Intelligence,Senior Consultant - BI,HR Success,Melbourne VIC 3000,,$90000-$99999,,"WHEN CLIENTS SAY, 'SEE WHAT CALUMO THINKS', THEY MEAN THE SENIORS.
You want to be the one they trust to guide them forward. Good. We want that too.

Role: Senior Consultant (Melbourne or Sydney-based)
We’re about driving the very best outcomes for our clients, helping them lift their performance. Long experience says a critical ingredient is the best people - people of capability, resilience and judgement.
Perhaps that's you.
We deliver award-winning, state-of-the-art business intelligence and corporate performance management (think budgets, forecasts, reporting and predictive analysis, except right, and meaningful, and actionable) for Finance, Operations and Executive Leadership. And we love it. We really do.
Our best people join us and they stay, because:
Our work has variety – our days do not get monotonous. We (and with our clients) challenge each other in a supportive environment and work together. Though this we (all) become more than we were. We push the bounds of Microsoft tech, and we are not chained to our keyboards. You’ll lead the work with a variety of clients, industries and projects.
Our work is with Clients - understanding their needs and designing and implementing solutions that help them.
We get to use the CALUMO software (developed and supported here in Australia) that leverages and realises the Microsoft business intelligence stack. You'll be designing that in, integrating, and making it dance.
Our environment is flexible, agile, inclusive and growing.
And we try hard to avoid bureaucracy – your good ideas get heard, road tested, and put to work.
We get to cross minds with some of the best BI people in the world.
The discussion is robust, and stands on respect for experience and success.
There is no better place to learn the art of Business Intelligence.
You’ll have a solid background of years in corporate performance improvement, probably in Finance, Tech, or Operations, and excellent outcomes-focussed technical skills in Excel and TSQL. You're fonder of the toolbox than the first aid kit. You've led project teams and execution before. We'll teach you CALUMO (the software and the philosophy). You'll have experience in data-warehousing, Analysis Services and MDX - if not, but you do have the desire to learn, we'll teach you that too. Then you'll be the one, leading the work with the Client, understanding (and sometimes helping set) the goals, settling the detail, designing, building, directing traffic, testing and deploying, with the experience and capability of the rest of CALUMO standing with you.
If this is you, we'll support you in extending your skills and we’ll pay you well, because this work is extremely valuable.
If you're interested, we need to speak, soon. Upload your CV, a cover note telling me how this is you, and the key question on your mind...",https://au.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=52285fa11294c6db&fccid=5d09b56cee820ec9&vjs=3,

The Wow

This is a cross-functional role that will interact with various teams across the organisation, such as Product Managers and Product Owners, Technical Operations, Development Managers and Teams, Central Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Commercial stakeholders.

The role is primarily intended to ensure we have dedicated focus on understanding the performance of our sites and apps, and the user experience across all key journeys and interactions.

Work with product managers and product owners to define product performance metrics and benchmarks for each metric, ensuring that all metrics are actively being measured against these benchmarks and following up when they are not;
Define plans and requirements for the automated detection and alerting of broken experiences or significant deviations from benchmarks, and work across teams to deliver such capabilities;
Maintain a record of what is being properly tracked and monitored and what is not, recommending priorities for adding new tracking and monitoring capabilities;
Prepare and communicate reports on product and user journey performance;
Either through central analytics or on own initiative, perform detailed analysis on visible trends or to support ad-hoc requests from product stakeholders;
In collaboration with the Product Management and UX teams, develop and own the digital experimentation roadmap for improving the customer experience and core KPIs through A/B and multi-variate testing;
Contribute to the design and delivery of our analytics capabilities and tag management strategy;
Manage and prioritise the backlog of works for the development team responsible for the the implementation of analytical and marketing tags and pixels and the set-up of digital experiments;
Take ownership for tools use specifically for analysing product performance and digital experimentation.

A/B and multivariate testing;
Google Analytics;
Using Business Intelligence and Operational Intelligence tools;
Understanding web technologies;
Strong communication, presentation and planning skills;
Analytical mind-set and confident working with data to drive product decisions.

What we offer

Much like riding a rollercoaster, sometimes life at Betsson can be lightning fast with twists and turns but always FUN! Then again, what else would you expect from a business 75% millennial and 1700 strong, spread across 7 offices with 900 based out of our Malta HQ alone! We recognise it may not be for the faint-hearted, but if you're a go-getter, initiator and adrenaline junkie, always striving to push the boundaries and challenge yourself, then you'll fit right in.

Business Intelligence,Sr. Strategy & Planning Associate,Uber,Sydney NSW 2000,,$110000-$119999,,"At Uber, we ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion. We take on big problems to help drivers, riders, delivery partners, and eaters get moving in more than 600 cities around the world.

We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let’s move the world forward, together.
About the Role

A successful strategy is essential to ANZs growth and financial contribution targets in 2020. The Strategy and Planning Associate will be responsible for creating actionable insights from the ground up, crafting strategies and tactics, and helping implement that plan across the region

The ideal candidate for this role will have strong analytical skills and an appetite for learning how data insights actually play out on the ground. They will need to navigate through stakeholders’ needs, be obsessed about making data-driven decisions and be super well organised. The position requires a strong ability to coordinate with multiple POCs across the business, manage relationships with functional areas and drive leadership buy-in.
What You'll Do:

Strategy

Help manage our regional P&L: In JUMP, there are a huge number of tradeoffs in the way that we make decisions (i.e. cost vs speed, deployment vs customer experience etc). You are key to helping drive to the right answer on those tradeoffs at a regional level. You need to know what data is needed and know how to present it to management in order to make the right call.
Intel & Insights generation: You will design methods to analyze market information, provide insights and shape strategies to guide JUMPs strategy in ANZ. Keep the team updated with competitive intel so we can stay ahead of the pack.

Planning

Planning: Planning in JUMP is very different to what is required in other parts of Uber. You need to understand hardware development, supply chains and certification timelines amongst others in order to help devise a workable plan for the region.
Organisation: You will then need to help manage the implementation of that plan. Because we operate hardware, there are more dependencies required over a longer period of time in order to implement our plan or strategy. You will be a centrepoint for coordinating efforts of the team and ensure these dependencies are all working in unison.

Prioritization: In Jump/NeMo we are never at a shortage of problems to tackle or projects to take on. You will need to be a strong influencer to ensure the team prioritizes the most impactful work first while not letting long term issues fall out of thought.

What You'll Need:

4+ years of work experience, preferably in Consulting, Business Intelligence, Investment Banking, is expected, but we'll evaluate candidates with less experience if they meet our other requirements
Top of the line Excel and data management skills
You need to be very well organised and have good project management skills
You will need to thrive with ambiguity and uncertainty. You need to be able to create order and a path forward when the answer isn’t clear.
SQL proficiency is a requirement, Python and R knowledge are a huge plus
Strong communication skills is a must - Taking complicated and complex issues and compiling into a clean and clear narrative. You will need to be able to influence the thinking of those above you as well as your peers
Strong business sense and creative approach with data to identify gaps in our value proposition
You need to be a self starter. There is lots of ‘white space’ in JUMP and you will need to know how to prioritise what work needs to be done and what doesn’t.",https://au.indeed.com/pagead/clk?mo=r&ad=-6NYlbfkN0AVIi8UxprrPGU7QPohOxOOpynq0pcPnEidcD-eE3H2SrVEVViDPJRCOBdMBR--EXsEAU5TxVih94hXFr14RwuyaXRu1W2I5Y0LMHUXpGFt7zOVTvS8a4UwEFx6X_YRzVG4NDQD2L2kKc06fx7h1D7w2k6QgbCo0f-K1kp515C4LdOI4Y7MJ5jY4udF3l318SZtfD5GtixuqKootuL_NdOQ3b5GxnpRJtt80LmAHiVGWqxg5x-glOPp8Ix244PQI8qWIVk8lG31MdXVXJOFr6le_Hi4TDXPNCX76YH1aaiHYd-B2P9ZPSjuIdVXKGNETK200nI2HQZC8ecCPTq29eRJfL5kzytkn5V5N_He_cWH_Z_cLwlo3Z-GJRXQdVzeTsfGBSmKrwosolVIRDJ5t8lnqD2MxzmeBQnqslLjJ0yy1f6_mx535IDV9KKrWIr9V12-pPrJELLlAN4dx9U_gihI8bXqorF-y2bpsAmxolrqmHrSuMTzKnKrXrbAi1KSiP1M7MmU1-teiBSrzgKNBImVctDO8vSA_u-4lDpYDqmpJGTCQlsO9cP0M7NNGmK8O5k9vmAESBbBp6OcmuCN05SP2QQ1Um15W5qtQunK0r2tudYbP1UosfieMb_DvFkv4aOKh6oX59TpLAOTvd9xWFpzkz06hjOYxXDaePNm29GDB0BwiyMWH_JGjZZuhanIfgCjUYrAomSD8doqixPMJTxMt8G1vSQzx4EvztflL2FGJ9btNEqXPLbkovHiJM4Jd0M2SSpV5pE54Fkg9DxXOspAwxQV-6ABc3sOZ9g56VQFYbj-JkulhOzquMSHrokUwh4LKAvnaCQZvgqeROmVeemiyh-FtMYpyRVejYY-77M-3J90cJX5_z4IGanH8q4CA1F7JGKi-asSSRQ0843AM9VZBw9Ekf_3n0_SXxxULpT_7UEnyZc7O1DlBzkxIF-LjcGEY1SIX5erg9o_UlLSgZzvzHV9LQnkmXtMcpATab34gA==&p=2&fvj=0&vjs=3,3.7

Push for progress, not perfection. There are very few overnight successes. Greatness is borne of many little victories (and failures). Share v 1.0, test it, and make it better. Then create the next version. Because the moment we think something is perfect, it will be obsolete.

Inclusive
Include, value and trust each other. We are smart alone but together we are genius. This means being inclusive, giving the benefit of the doubt and being responsible for each other. Because, for our company to thrive for the next 100+ years, smart isn’t enough. We need genius.

Business Intelligence,"Strategy & Planning Lead, Uber for Business",Uber,Sydney NSW 2000,,$140000-$149999,,"About Uber for Business

Uber for Business is a suite of products that allows companies to improve the travel and eating experience of their employees, customers, patients and guests. Through utilising Uber’s technology we are able to provide unparalleled data for improved management and transparency over a company’s travel spend. As we continue to develop products we look toward creating a frictionless experience for companies and the people that they serve to be able to consume Uber’s services.

With over 10000 customers across Australia and New Zealand the U4B A/NZ team strive to continually find new ways to improve the experiences of our customers. The ANZ team is comprised of Enterprise and Mid Market AEs, CSMs, BDRs, Account Specialists and Marketing and we operate a really driven, fun, transparent and trustworthy culture. We truly believe that “The Whole is Greater than the Sum of its Parts”

At Uber, we ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion. We take on big problems to help drivers, riders, delivery partners, and eaters get moving in more than 600 cities around the world.

We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let’s move the world forward, together.
About the Role

Over the last few years Uber for Business has become the platform of choice for Government and Enterprises in A/NZ. We are constantly innovating to drive value for our customers and last year alone we launched 2 new major products into the platform in A/NZ that enabled companies to now work with us across a number of travel and eating use cases. This role is responsible for pushing our thinking beyond the here and now and there are some exciting opportunities for growth yet to come. While this role sits in the Uber for Business (U4B) team, you will also work collaboratively on a number of key initiatives with the wider Uber rides and Uber Eats business. You will work with senior leaders in the business to identify ways we can better service the needs of the business traveller (one of the company’s top priorities for 2020) and their company.

The S&P Lead will design cross-collaboration frameworks, deliver strong data-driven analysis, is an expert problem solver, and able to dive deep on all areas of the business (from tech to go-to-market) to deliver creative solutions. Reporting into the Global Head of S&P, and working closely with regional GMs and Country Managers this person will dig into data, uncover insights, and then develop and socialise a viewpoint on where to play and how to win globally across our breadth of U4B solutions.

It would be no surprise that you love driving strategic thinking, finding truth and insight into tough, unstructured problems and working with senior leaders. However this is no normal S&P role in a normal company.

Compile competitive intelligence (e.g,. Product offering, go to market) and distill competitive insights
Routinely present results of business case modeling and analysis, and act as a thought partner to U4B team leads across the globe and the Global Head of Uber for Business

What You’ll Need:
